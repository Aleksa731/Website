                   is a term referring to genetically-engineered 
                  creatures developed by the United States military to replace humans 
                 during close-combat search-and-destroy missions. They escaped into the
                   wild in the aftermath of the Great War, and over the next few decades
                 colonized much of the former United States, becoming apex predators 
                  in many of the new, post-War ecosystems.</p>

                  are the third stage of the infected. They take roughly a year to reach this 
                   stage of infection after exposure to the Cordyceps brain infection. They
                   have had prolonged exposure to the fungus, and now possess strength that 
                   significantly surpasses the average human.</p>
